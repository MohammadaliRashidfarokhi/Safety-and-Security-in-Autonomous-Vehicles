   ABSTRACT   = { Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to shape urban life and significantly modify travel behaviors. “Autonomous technology” means technology that can drive a vehicle without active physical control or monitoring by a human operator. The first AV fleets are already in service in US cities. AVs offer a variety of automation, vehicle ownership, and vehicle use options. AVs could increase some health risks (such as air pollution, noise, and sedentarism); however, if proper regulated, AVs will likely reduce morbidity and mortality from motor vehicle crashes and may help reshape cities to promote healthy urban environments. Healthy models of AV use include fully electric vehicles in a system of ridesharing and ridesplitting. Public health will benefit if proper policies and regulatory frameworks are implemented before the complete introduction of AVs into the market. }

ABSTRACT = {Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) combine technologies of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and connected vehicles (CVs) to develop quicker, more reliable, and safer traffic. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based CAV solutions play significant roles in sustainable cities. The convergence imposes stringent security requirements for CAV safety and reliability. In practice, vehicles are developed with increased automation and connectivity. Increased automation increases the reliance on the sensor-based technologies and decreases the reliance on the driver; increased connectivity increases the exposures of vehicles&rsquo; vulnerability and increases the risk for an adversary to implement a cyber-attack. Much work has been dedicated to identifying the security vulnerabilities and recommending mitigation techniques associated with different sensors, controllers, and connection mechanisms, respectively. However, there is an absence of comprehensive and in-depth studies to identify how the cyber-attacks exploit the vehicles&rsquo; vulnerabilities to negatively impact the performance and operations of CAVs. In this survey, we set out to thoroughly review the security issues introduced by AV and CV technologies, analyze how the cyber-attacks impact the performance of CAVs, and summarize the solutions correspondingly. The impact of cyber-attacks on the performance of CAVs is elaborated from both viewpoints of intra-vehicle systems and inter-vehicle systems. We pointed out that securing the perception and operations of CAVs would be the top requirement to enable CAVs to be applied safely and reliably in practice. Additionally, we suggested to utilize cloud and new AI methods to defend against smart cyber-attacks on CAVs.},

abstract = {Perception system design is a vital step in the development of an autonomous vehicle (AV). With the vast selection of available off-the-shelf schemes and seemingly endless options of sensor systems implemented in research and commercial vehicles, it can be difficult to identify the optimal system for one’s AV application. This article presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art AV perception technology available today. It provides up-to-date information about the advantages, disadvantages, limits, and ideal applications of specific AV sensors; the most prevalent sensors in current research and commercial AVs; autonomous features currently on the market; and localization and mapping methods currently implemented in AV research. This information is useful for newcomers to the AV field to gain a greater understanding of the current AV solution landscape and to guide experienced researchers towards research areas requiring further development. Furthermore, this paper highlights future research areas and draws conclusions about the most effective methods for AV perception and its effect on localization and mapping. Topics discussed in the Perception and Automotive Sensors section focus on the sensors themselves, whereas topics discussed in the Localization and Mapping section focus on how the vehicle perceives where it is on the road, providing context for the use of the automotive sensors. By improving on current state-of-the-art perception systems, AVs will become more robust, reliable, safe, and accessible, ultimately providing greater efficiency, mobility, and safety benefits to the public.}

abstract = {Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) offer a huge potential to improve the operations and safety of transportation systems. However, the use of smart devices and communications in CAVs introduce new risks. CAVs would leverage vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication, thus providing additional system access points compared to traditional systems. Automation makes these systems more vulnerable and increases the consequences of cyberattacks. This study utilizes an infrastructure-based communication platform consisting of cooperative adaptive cruise control and lane control advisories developed by the authors to perform cyber risk assessment of CAVs. The study emulates three types of cyberattacks (message falsification, dedicated denial of service, and spoofing attacks) in a representative traffic environment consisting of multiple CAV platoons and lane change events to analyze the safety and stability impacts of the cyberattacks. Simulation experiments using VISSIM reveals that traffic stream and CAV string is unstable under all three types of cyberattacks. The worst case is represented by the message falsification attack. Increases in volatility are observed over a no attack case, with variations increasing by an average of 43%–51% along with an increase of over 3000 crash conflicts. Similarly, lane change crash conflicts are observed to be more severe compared to rear end crash conflicts, showing a higher probability of severe injuries. Further, the case of slight cyberattack on a single CAV also creates significant disruption in the traffic stream. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) reveals the statistical significance of the results. These results pave the way for future design of secure systems from a monitoring perspective.}

ABSTRACT = {Vehicular technology has recently gained increasing popularity, and autonomous driving is a hot topic. To achieve safe and reliable intelligent transportation systems, accurate positioning technologies need to be built to factor in the different types of uncertainties such as pedestrian behavior, random objects, and types of roads and their settings. In this work, we look into the other domains and technologies required to build an autonomous vehicle and conduct a relevant literature analysis. In this work, we look into the current state of research and development in environment detection, pedestrian detection, path planning, motion control, and vehicle cybersecurity for autonomous vehicles. We aim to study the different proposed technologies and compare their approaches. For a car to become fully autonomous, these technologies need to be accurate enough to gain public trust and show immense accuracy in their approach to solving these problems. Public trust and perception of auto vehicles are also explored in this paper. By discussing the opportunities as well as the obstacles of autonomous driving technology, we aim to shed light on future possibilities.},

abstract = {As vehicles become autonomous and connected, intelligent management techniques can be utilized to operate an intersection without a traffic light. When a Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) approaches an intersection, it shares its status and intended direction with the Intersection Manager (IM), and the IM checks the status of other CAVs and assigns a target velocity/reference trajectory for it to maintain. In practice, however, there is an unknown delay between the time a CAV sends a request to the IM and the moment it receives back the response, namely, the Round-Trip Delay (RTD). As a result, the CAV will start tracking the target velocity/reference trajectory later than when the IM expects, which may lead to accidents. In this article, we present a time-aware approach, Crossroads+, that makes CAVs’ behaviors deterministic despite the existence of the unknown RTD. In Crossroads+, we use timestamping and synchronization to ensure that both the IM and the CAVs have the same notion of time. The IM will also set a fixed start time to track the target velocity/reference trajectory for each CAV. The effectiveness of the proposed Crossroads+ technique is illustrated by experiments on a 1/10 scale model of an intersection with CAVs. We also built a simulator to demonstrate the scalability of Crossroads+ for multi-lane intersections. Results from our experiments indicate that our approach can reduce the position uncertainty by 15% in comparison with conventional techniques and achieve up to 36% better throughputs.},

abstract = {The precise measuring of vehicle location has been a critical task in enhancing the autonomous driving in terms of intelligent decision making and safe transportation. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an important infrastructure in support of autonomous driving, allowing real-time road information exchanging and sharing for localizing vehicles. Global positioning System (GPS) is widely used in the traditional IoV system. GPS is unable to meet the key application requirements of autonomous driving due to meter level error and signal deterioration. In this article, we propose a novel solution, named Semi-Direct Monocular Visual-Inertial Odometry using Point and Line Features (SDMPL-VIO) for precise vehicle localization. Our SDMPL-VIO model takes advantage of a low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and monocular camera, using them as the sensor to acquire the surrounding environmental information. Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), taking into account both point and line features, is proposed, which is able to deal with both weak texture and dynamic environment. We use a semi-direct method to deal with keyframes and non-keyframes, respectively. Dual sliding window mechanisms can effectively fuse point-line and IMU information. To evaluate our SDMPL-VIO system model, we conduct extensive experiments on both an indoor dataset (i.e., EuRoC) and an outdoor dataset (i.e., KITTI) from the real-world applications, respectively. The experimental results show that the accuracy of SDMPL-VIO proposed by us is better than the mainstream VIO system at present. Especially in the weak texture of the datasets, fast-moving datasets, and other challenging datasets, SDMPL-VIO has a relatively high robustness.},
